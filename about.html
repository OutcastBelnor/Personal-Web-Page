			<h1>About my assignment</h1>
			<p>Looking at the assignment worksheet in the beginning I felt a little overwhelmed. I wasn't to confident with no practicals (except for the voluntary ones) to write my own website that would look good. But then I started looking on the web for the tutorials and found one very good (it's in polish but here's the link for all Poles: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M0YXFW31hg" target="_blank">Mirosław Zelent - HMTL5</a>). It was divided into 3 three parts: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It helped me a lot so I recommend it to everyone who can understand it. After watching it I had a very good sense of what I want to do.</p>
			<p>But I still didn't have any idea what design I want to have. After all I decided to do it white and red which are the colors of polish flag. I must admit it was a good choice and it came out nicely. At first I wanted to do a horizontal menu, but then I found out it was specified to do a side one. To spice up my website I used nice fonts from the website <a href="http://google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. These are called Ubuntu Mono and Rubik Mono One. I had fun editing the look of my site with CSS. I came up with the idea to round the edges of different blocks. I got this and many other things from <a href="http://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a>.</p>
			<p>When I was done with the design and structure of my website I started typing the welcoming script. It wasn't too hard. I did both the message from the site (alert() in js) and swapping the input boxes with text, as well as the appropriate welcoming for the time of the day. Again the <a href="http://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a> website was very helpful.</p>
			<p>My friend Szymon and I helped each other a couple times, I also got esthetic advice from my brother. I used Chrome, Mozilla and Internet Explorer for testing (all of them were the newest  version) and they all displayed my site properly. Overall I am satisfied with my work and had a lot of fun doing this assignment!</p>
